// Encapsulation -  basically means ki ek class ka data and functions ko ek unit ma bandh dena ya fir ek unit ma form kar dana 
/*
 * Jaise hum data ya fir class ki properties and uska functions (yani ki methods) ko ek unit ma form kar dana and unit jisko 
 * hum class bolta hai.
 */

//  Data hiding -  basically it means ki konsa data kisko dekhana hai and kisko nhi and this can be achieved using Access modifiers
/*
 * Access modifiers are :-
 * 1. Default - These are predefined and is usually defined in java
 * 2. Private - These are only access by its own class and can't be accessed outside the class even subclass can't access it
 * 3. Public - These can be access by the class that calls it as package and subclass can also access it. i.e., can be accessed by anyone
 * 4. Protected -  which is it can be accessed in its package and only subclass can use it which the package is imported.
 */
// To access private things in class we have getters and setters
    /*
     * Getters - give the value of the private things in the class.
     * Setters - set the value of the private things in the class.
